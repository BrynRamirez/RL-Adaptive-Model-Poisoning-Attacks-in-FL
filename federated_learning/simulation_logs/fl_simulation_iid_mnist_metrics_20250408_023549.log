2025-04-08 02:35:49 - INFO - Starting Federated Learning Simulation: dataset type: iid, dataset name: mnist, strategy: FedAvg(accept_failures=True), rounds: 20, clients: 20
2025-04-08 02:35:49 - WARNING - DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.simulation.start_simulation() is deprecated.
	Instead, use the `flwr run` CLI command to start a local simulation in your Flower app, as shown for example below:

		$ flwr new  # Create a new Flower app from a template

		$ flwr run  # Run the Flower app in Simulation Mode

	Using `start_simulation()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
